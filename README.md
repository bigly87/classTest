# MPC test code

Please not at MPC we comply with pep8 coding standards and 
Google Style Python Docstrings,
please implement those techniques into your python script.


Class vs. Instance

Write a Person class with an instance variable `age` 
and a constructor that takes an integer `initial_age` as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign `initial_age` to `age` after validating the
 value in`initial_age`. In addition,
  you must write the following 
 instance methods:

1.`year_passes()` should increase the `age` instance variable by 1.


2.`what_am_i()` should perform the following conditional actions:
    1.if age < 13 print `You are young...`
    2.if `age >= 13` and `age < 18`, print `You are a teenager...`
    
    3.Otherwise, print `You are an adult...`  """
